PoopDisplay:
A Display Interface Class-Based Scratch 1.4 API for use in Python 3

PoopDisplay.py - the class file
test_example.py - example code that runs through all API functions
TestDisplay.sb - sample Scratch to show the effects of test_example.py

[TESTING THE DISPLAY INTERFACE]

1. place everything in the same directory 
2. Load TestDisplay.sb into Scratch 1.4
3. Make sure the remote sensors are ENABLED
4. Click on GREEN FLAG
5. run test_example.py

[TODO LIST]

A 5 digit rotating display has already been coded up. 
It's currently only implemented in Scratch2. 
I need to port it across to Scratch1.4 - should be easy enough.
